Principles of Data Engineering tools?
Highly Extensible (programmable) systems
Easily configurable - just sending a config file. 
pipilining systems 
Specification of dependencies
consistent grammar (Self documenting)
parallel + distributed processing


We need to travel back in time to the present to refresh on skills specially for data engineering 
We use a language called bash

Unix:
Navigation
Manipulating files/directories
Inspecting contents 
>ls
>ls -a
>ls -l
>ls -h
>ls -ahl for all of the above
Home directory: > cd ~
previous directory > cd -
Parent Directory >
to move it > mv .bash~/.bashrc
make a nested subdir ./data/raw   >mkdir -p data/raw
>wc -1 .bashrc       /thats just for the line count.
Get the word count
for big data: > tail schedule.cvs


Becoming a happy and productive engineer 
For graphics and animations use GUI
for a  lot of txt driven processing> file navigation, manipulation, searching USE: Command line.
